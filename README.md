# stix-docker
> Dockerfile for Ryan Layer's stix sv annotator + associated tools

This is my first docker image. 

I had trouble installing giggle + stix (libcurl hatred in shared HPC with make-based install).

Tools in this image:  
- Samtools: [https://github.com/samtools/samtools](https://github.com/samtools/samtools)  
- STIX: [https://github.com/ryanlayer/stix](https://github.com/ryanlayer/stix)  
- excord: [https://github.com/brentp/excord](https://github.com/brentp/excord)  
- giggle: [https://github.com/ryanlayer/giggle](https://github.com/ryanlayer/giggle)  

I made this with motivation and starting point here: https://github.com/apaul7/docker-stix
